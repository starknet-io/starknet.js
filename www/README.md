# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn    # or npm i
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start    # or npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build    # or npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy    # or USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy    # or GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Documentation location

Documentation for previous versions is located in [/www/versioned_docs](/www/versioned_docs) and normally does not need to be modified.
Documentation for the future official release of your work is located in [/www/docs](/www/docs) of your branch. There you have the API documentation in [/www/docs/API](/www/docs/API) and the guides in [/www/docs/guides](/www/docs/guides).
Official documentation is available to users at [www.starknetjs.com](https://www.starknetjs.com/). You can choose the documentation version you need in the top menu bar. NEXT version corresponds to the documentation of the last commit of the `develop` branch.

## Update documentation

Appropriate [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comments should be included in the source code. Such comments are used to populate the content for `/www/docs/API`, this content will be automatically generated by the project CI, and should not be included in Pull Requests. The content for `/www/docs/guides` should be updated manually and the modifications should be included in Pull Requests.

### Without creation of a new release of Starknet.js

Your modified files will just be merged in `/www/docs/` by the Pull Request. If it was merged in `develop`, it will be visible in the official documentation in NEXT.

### With creation of a new release of Starknet.js

Just before the release of a new version in the `main` branch documentation versioning should be performed:

#### Through CI

- Execute the `[Manual] Documentation Version PR` CI workflow to generate an appropriate PR

#### Manually

- Ensure that all the necessary commits/PRs/merges are performed
- Ensure that the `www` directory is up to date

- Execute the documentation build with the appropriate version tag used in the documentation code links with one of the following:

```bash
# from the root directory, use the module version from package.json
npm run docs:build:version

# from the root directory, manually set the version
npm run docs:build --git-revision-override=vX.Y.Z

# from the /www documentation directory, manually set the version
GIT_REVISION_OVERRIDE=vX.Y.Z npm run build
```

- Launch the documentation versioning with one of the following:

```bash
# from the root directory, use the module version from package.json
npm run docs:version

# from the root directory, manually set the version
npm run docs:version --version-override=X.Y.Z

# from the /www documentation directory, manually set the version
npm run docusaurus docs:version X.Y.Z
```

- The official documentation (API + guides) of `X.Y.Z` is created
- Commit your work, and merge it in `develop`
- perform the official release of `X.Y.Z` in `main`
- In the official documentation, the new version of documentation for `X.Y.Z` is available, and NEXT version is temporarily identical
