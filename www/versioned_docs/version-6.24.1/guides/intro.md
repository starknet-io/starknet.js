# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
# use the main branch

npm install starknet

# to use latest features (merges in develop branch)

npm install starknet@next
```

## Running tests locally

Local tests rely on <ins>[Starknet Devnet](https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs)</ins>, a local testnet emulation.

Launch a Devnet instance and run:

```bash
npm run test # all tests
npm run test ./__tests__/contract.test.ts # just one test suite
```

## Running docs locally

If you want to make changes to the documentation and see how it looks before making a PR:

```bash
cd www
npm install # install docusaurus
npm run start # fires up a local documentation site
```

## Compiling Starknet contracts

Please check the Starknet documentation <ins>[here](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/quick_start/declare_a_smart_contract/#compiling_a_smart_contract)</ins> to compile Starknet contracts.

Additional helpful resources can also be found at <ins>[OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.6.1/)</ins> documentation site.
